max kmer in sequence?
random selction of

initial selection of kmer (las vegas algorithim)

Shannon entropy
need 2 bits to evaluate what is happening in any one column accounting for all bases
the range of values requred to score is baed on number of bases that can occur in that column
max score of 13-mer is 26 bits
